Developing Stu
==============

This is information for hacking Stu itself.

'TODO.stu' lists the next features to be implemented.

'UNIMPLEMENTED.stu' lists things we're unlikely to implement. 

'CODING' gives the coding standards used in Stu. 

==== SETUP ====

Stu uses the GNU Auto* tools.  For development, use "make -f
Makefile.devel".  Yes, the GNU Auto* tools lose on many grounds, and it
would be *much* nicer to use Stu instead, but obviously Stu should be
compilable without Stu.

Before pushing changes to Github:
* Increment the version number in VERSION
* Run 'make -f Makefile.devel' successfully

Version logic (see 'NEWS' for an explanation of version numbers): 
* Increment the patch version number for any changes
* Increment the minor version number when backward-compatible new syntax
  is introduced   
* Increment the major version number when backward-incompatible new
  syntax is introduced (which we try to avoid)

==== DEBUG VERSION ====

The file 'stu.debug' is the Stu executable with all debugging turned on,
i.e., with debugging symbols, all warnings enabled, etc.  The exact
flags for compiling this are set in 'Makefile.devel', and you might have
to tweak these flags if you are developing Stu on another setup than the
authors.

==== UNIT TESTS ====

Unit testing is described in 'sh/mktest'. 

The command

	make -f Makefile.devel 

will also execute all unit tests.  This takes about ten minutes.   

When we add new functionality, we always add unit tests for it, covering
both success and failure.  

If you run the tests and they fail, report that to Jérôme Kunegis
<kunegis@gmail.com>.  

==== REQUIREMENTS ====

Running 'make -f Makefile.devel' has more requirements than just
compiling Stu:

* The unit tests assume that the file system supports UTF-8 filenames.
  Stu will work without such a file system, but you can't run the unit
  tests unless you remove the one offending test (test/unicode/).  
* You need to install the packages 'expect' and 'autoconf'.  On some
  systems, also 'tclsh'.  (Exact packages vary by operating system.)
