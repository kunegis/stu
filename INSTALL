========= INSTALLING STU =========

To install Stu, run this:

$ ./configure  # optional, accepts $CXX and $CXXFLAGS
$ make
$ sudo make install

This will compile and install Stu as well as its manpage on your
system.

To install in a specific directory, set $prefix when doing "make install".  The
default is "/usr/local".  For instance, to install in the home directory, do

$ prefix=$HOME make install

(Be aware that "sudo" may not pass through environment variables.)

If 'make' fails, you may need to change the compiler or the compiler flags.
They are stored in conf/, or you can "make clean" and run ./configure again with
$CXX and $CXXFLAGS set.  For instance, to compile with Clang, do

$ CXX=clang++ ./configure

Stu is still a quite small program, and has not been tested on many
systems.

Stu is developed primarily on Linux, and has been used on FreeBSD, OS X
10.11, macOS 10.12, and Microsoft Windows 10.  It has been compiled with
both GCC and Clang.

--------- Arch Linux ---------

Stu can be installed on Arch Linux via the following package, which will
fetch the current version from Github and compile it locally:

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stu-git/

Credits for the package go to Holger Heinz (hheinz).

==== REQUIREMENTS ====

Stu requires:
* POSIX
* A C++ 14 compiler

In addition, Stu uses the following features:
* ASCII or an ASCII-compatible 8-bit encoding such as UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1
* ANSI color code-compatible terminal (terminfo or termcap are not used)
* "make install" uses the "install" tool, which is portable but not
  standardized.

If you want to develop Stu (or run the tests), there are more dependencies, see
devel/DEVEL.

==== COMPILATION OPTIONS ====

These are detected automatically by sh/conf, but you may change them
by hand if necessary.

* USE_MTIM (default: enabled if CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE is present):  Use struct
  timespec instead of time_t for timekeeping.  struct timespec supports
  nanosecond timestamps in principle. In practice, most systems are likely to
  support only a precision on the order of a millisecond.  Works only on Linux,
  as it uses CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE.  See the comments in 'src/timestamp.hh'.

==== UNIT TESTS ====

This is optional, but will give you confidence that your compiled Stu
works correctly.

Execute all unit tests using 'make test'.  If an error is reported, report
it to <kunegis@gmail.com>.  It takes about five minutes (running the tests, not
reporting to the developers).  Unit tests need "expect" to be installed.
