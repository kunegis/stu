========= INSTALLING STU =========

To install Stu, run this:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

This will compile and install Stu as well as its manpage on your
system. 

If ./configure fails, then you are probably out of luck.  This is the
Autoconf-produced configure script and should not fail.  You may go on
compiling Stu by hand though, if you know what you are doing. 

If 'make' fails, you can go into the 'Makefile' and tweak some
variables:
* If compilation fails, you may need to add or remove options
  from CXXFLAGS.
* If your compiler does not support -std=c++14, try replacing it with
  -std=c++0x, or whatever flags makes your compiler use C++14. 
* If linking fails, you may need to add libraries to the LIBS variable
  (e.g., -lrt).  

Stu is still a quite small program, and has not been tested on many
systems.  

Stu is developed primarily on Linux, and has been used on FreeBSD, OS X
10.11, macOS 10.12, and Microsoft Windows 10.  It has been compiled with
both GCC and Clang.

--------- Arch Linux ---------

Stu can be installed on Arch Linux via the following package, which will
fetch the current version from Github and compile it locally:

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stu-git/

==== REQUIREMENTS ====

Stu requires:
* POSIX
* A C++14 compiler 

In addition, Stu uses the following features, about which we are not
100% sure that they are prescribed by POSIX: 
* ASCII or an ASCII-compatible 8-bit encoding such as UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1
* ANSI color code-compatible terminal (terminfo or termcap are not used)

==== COMPILATION OPTIONS ====

These are detected automatically by ./configure, but you may change them
by hand if necessary. 

* USE_MTIM (default: enabled if CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE is present):  Use
  struct timespec instead of time_t for timekeeping.  struct timespec
  supports nanosecond timestamps in principle. In practice, most systems
  are likely to support only a precision on the order of a millisecond.
  Works only on Linux, as it uses CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE.  See the
  comments in 'timestamp.hh'.  

==== UNIT TESTS ====

This is optional, but will give you confidence that your compiled Stu
works correctly. 

Execute all unit tests using 'make -f Makefile.devel all-test'.  If an
error is reported, report it to <kunegis@gmail.com>.  It takes about
five minutes (running the tests, not reporting to the developers).
