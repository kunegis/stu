========= INSTALLING STU =========

To install Stu, run this:

$ make
$ sudo make install

This will compile and install Stu as well as its manpage on your
system. 

To install in a specific directory, set $prefix when doing "make install".  The
default is "/usr/local".

If 'make' fails, you may need to change the compiler or the compiler flags.
They are stored in conf, or you can "make clean" and run make again with $CXX
and $CXXFLAGS set.

Stu is still a quite small program, and has not been tested on many
systems.

Stu is developed primarily on Linux, and has been used on FreeBSD, OS X
10.11, macOS 10.12, and Microsoft Windows 10.  It has been compiled with
both GCC and Clang.

--------- Arch Linux ---------

Stu can be installed on Arch Linux via the following package, which will
fetch the current version from Github and compile it locally:

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stu-git/

Credits for the package go to Holger Heinz (hheinz). 


==== REQUIREMENTS ====

Stu requires:
* POSIX
* A C++ 14 compiler

In addition, Stu uses the following features, about which we are not
100% sure that they are prescribed by POSIX: 
* ASCII or an ASCII-compatible 8-bit encoding such as UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1
* ANSI color code-compatible terminal (terminfo or termcap are not used)
* "make install" uses the "install" tool, which is portable but not
  standardized. 

If you want to develop Stu (or run the tests), there are more dependencies, see
devel/DEVEL. 

==== COMPILATION OPTIONS ====

These are detected automatically by sh/conf, but you may change them
by hand if necessary. 

* USE_MTIM (default: enabled if CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE is present):  Use
  struct timespec instead of time_t for timekeeping.  struct timespec
  supports nanosecond timestamps in principle. In practice, most systems
  are likely to support only a precision on the order of a millisecond.
  Works only on Linux, as it uses CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE.  See the
  comments in 'src/timestamp.hh'.

==== UNIT TESTS ====

This is optional, but will give you confidence that your compiled Stu
works correctly. 

Execute all unit tests using 'make test'.  If an error is reported, report
it to <kunegis@gmail.com>.  It takes about five minutes (running the tests, not
reporting to the developers).
