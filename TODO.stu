#=================== New features =======================

#
# Cloning:  Don't clone things unnecessarily
#

#
# File import
#

# Import all rules from subdirectory; will prepend the directory name to
# all targets.  Rules from there will be executed from within the
# directory as current directory.  If using 'import', the meaning of
 
# All these are equivalent 
% import src/main.stu
% import src/
% import src
% include -d src/main.stu
% include -d src/
% include -d src

# - What about transient targets imported in that way.  Do we
#   prepend a directory to them?
%import dir   # contains:   @all:  ...;
# gets converted to:       @dir/all:  ...;
# or to:                   dir/@all:  ...;  # ???

#
# When including files using dynamic dependencies, make a
# difference between inclusion and import, as is done for %include and
# %import. 
#

A: [-d data/B];

#
# Search within predefined paths for %include ($STU_PATH or $STUPATH;
# the -I option)
#

# This is included from the "Stu path", and could be installed in
# e.g. /usr/share/stu/lib/ or ~/share/stu/lib/, etc. 
% include c++.stu
 
#
# Line number and file syntax:  A preprocessor-like construct that gives a new
# filename and line number, such that error messages from Stu can point
# to the original file, not the generated file.  Analogous to the
# preprocessors #line directive.  Useful in dynamic dependencies. 
#

% file datasets.list
% line 120

# Use this in stu-utils/texdep and other stu-utils programs judiciously. 

#
# Have an option to output the dependency graph, i.e., output each edge
# on a single line, e.g. separated by tab.  (Use it then to perform a network
# analysis of the KONECT-Analysis dependency graph.)
#

#
# In -j>1 mode, Start trivial dependencies immediately when it is clear
# they must be started, not just when everything else is done.
