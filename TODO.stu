# Play around with __builtin_unreachable() for assert.  (Will later be some form of assume, C++23)
#

#
# Use string_view where appropriate. (needs C++17)
#

#
# preset.h:  Use to_address(v.end()) instead of v.data() + v.size()
#

#
# Fuzzing:  move it to be a test
#

#
# Try out various sanitizers (some may need a newer GCC)
#    -fsanitize=leak
#    -fsanitize=undefined 
#    -fsanitize=address      // not used because of false positives (due to Execution caching)
#    <others>
