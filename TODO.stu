# Use backslash for quoting.  I.e., allow \X where X is any character
# outside of quotes to represent X.  
#
# Rules:
#   \ before newline:  nothing
#   \ before any other character:  that character
#        - normal characters that don't need quotes
#             - UTF-8 encoded characters?
#        - characters that need quotes 
#   \ at end of file:  error
