#
# Stu uses Autoconf for configuration.  Autoconf is run by the
# developers to generate 'configure', 'Makefile' and other files.  These
# can then be used to compile Stu, even without having Autoconf
# installed. 
#
# The main purpose of using Autoconf (as opposed to having a simple
# POSIX-compliant Makefile), is to recognize capabilities of the system
# to enable and disable certain features.
#
# In principle, Stu should use only POSIX features, and Autoconf would
# be unnecessary, as a single POSIX-compliant codebase would compile on
# all platforms.  In practice, this fails in two ways:
#
#  - Some systems don't follow POSIX, but working around that is easy,
#    so missing out on these systems is not worth it. 
#  - Some nonstandard features are too useful to not use, but not having
#    them still allows a very useful version of Stu.
#
# However, we try to keep these configuration options to a strict
# minimum.  At the moment there is just one:  using
# CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE on Linux, which enables nanosecond-precision
# timestamps in line with the filesystem.
