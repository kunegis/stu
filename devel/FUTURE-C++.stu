# These are changes that will need newer versions of the C++ standard and/or
# compilers than what we use now.

#
# preset.h:  Use to_address(v.end()) instead of v.data() + v.size()  (C++20).
#

#
# Use standard formatting functions instead of our own.  (C++20)  We can also
# use custom formatters for the colors, etc.
#

#
# Use Assume (C++23).
#

#
# Use flat_map where appropriate (C++23).
#

#
# Replace unreachable() by std::unreachable() (C++23).
