-p data: { mkdir data ; }

# Alternatively, we may introduce the rule that for directories, the
# modification date is not used.  (Not a good idea because the date may
# be useful for directories in some cases.)

# This can also work with other flags.

#
# Have an option to block certain targets from ever being rebuilt.  (Resulting
# in a failure when they should, or always considering them up to date.)  May
# also be implemented in Stu syntax, i.e. something like:
#

-n FILENAME;

# This would override a previous rule for FILENAME.

#
# Allow access to environment variables via e.g. $(HOME).  Using this is
# likely to be an antipattern -- the idiomatic thing to do is set a
# symlink to the directory in question.  Other cases are even worse,
# e.g., having environment variables with lists of things in them.
#
# On the other hand, this will be useful after extended inclusion is
# implemented, to pass paths to Stu libraries.
#

#
# Make '~' work as the home directory.  Also for ~user/.  '~' is already
# forbidden as the first character in unquoted names.
#

#
# Allow to handle symlinks as files in themselves, i.e., check for their
# own existence and their own timestamp.  This should not be the default
# as the current behaviour is more often useful, but should be available
# as a possibility, probably using a new flag (-L).
#

#
# File import
#

# Import all rules from subdirectory; will prepend the directory name to
# all targets.  Rules from there will be executed from within the
# directory as current directory.  If using 'import', the meaning of
# all these are equivalent:
% import src/main.stu
% import src/
% import src
% include -d src/main.stu
% include -d src/
% include -d src
# The flag -d can be something else.

# - What about transient targets imported in that way.  Do we
#   prepend a directory to them?
%import dir   # contains:   @all:  ...;
# gets converted to:       @dir/all:  ...;
# or to:                   dir/@all:  ...;  # ???

#
# Check out that -Pq can work as a "lint mode"
#

#
# Color in -P output
#

#
# Color in the usual output "Successfully built X" and the error equivalent
#

#
# When doing %include or %import, allow to pass environment variables.
#

#
# Does it make sense to have a way to set environment variables for all
# commands?  It would open us up to many additional questions, and
# potentially some Make-like anti-patterns.  In general, Stu directives
# are prone to implement anti-patterns, as what they do is global.

# analysis of the KONECT-Analysis dependency graph.)

#
# Line number and file syntax:  A preprocessor-like construct that gives a new
# filename and line number, such that error messages from Stu can point
# to the original file, not the generated file.  Analogous to the
# preprocessors #line directive.  Useful in dynamic dependencies.

# In this example, when 'program' does not exist, Stu will *not* build
