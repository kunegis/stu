# Rename tests
# * sh/test
# ** add "testing"
# ** add test variant (ndebug, etc.)
# ** Check what happens when a test fails
# ** Output runtime as part of the last line ("tests successful", etc.).  There
#    should be just a single line output in verbose=0 mode.
# ** add progress %
# ** add success % and color
# ** Make sure test names are not too long
# ** devel/README:  make sure the unicode test has the correct name
# * create a test that no tests have committed subdirectories
# * Rename all all-X makefile targets to X
# * Begin with the version number in which the feature that they
#   are testing was introduced.
# * Rename tests so that version numbers are zero-padded to make execution order
#   consistent
# * Avoid a bare "1" or "2" (rename to 1.00 and 2.00)
# * Some tests are slow even though they don't contain "sleep".  Move them also
#   to long-*.
# * in the terminal, sh/test is not interruptable with Ctrl-C.
