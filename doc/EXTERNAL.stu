# These features can be implemented outside of Stu using constructs
# supported by Stu.  Thus, there is no need to integrate them into Stu,
# and in fact supporting them would bloat Stu and unnecessary
# dependencies to it.
#
# If anything, the question we should ask for each of these features is
# not whether we should hardcode it into Stu, but how easily these
# things can be implemented using the Stu language.  If necessary, we
# may then extend the Stu language to make such implementations
# possible, and easy.

#
# Things that can be implemented by simply using the appropriate
# commands:
#
# * Compression, archiving, and encryption
# * Converting encodings, line endings, and processing escape sequences
# * Limitations on runtime, memory usages and other resources by jobs
# * Calling interpreters or compilers for specific programming languages
#

#
# Run jobs in a distributed fashion, i.e., on different hosts.  The idea
# here would be to use any software for distributing jobs and call it
# for each Stu job.  This would slightly interfere with what Stu itself
# is doing, since a distributed job management system also has to decide
# when a job is executed.  Most also have dependency management
# capabilities.
