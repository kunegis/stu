==== Which Stu version am I using?

Do this:

$ stu -V

==== When I change the content of a hardcoded rule, Stu does not rebuild
     the file

That is correct.  To get the desired behaviour, create the file by hand
and edit it directly.

Example:  The file 'main.stu' contains

    CFLAGS = { -O2 }
    program: program.c $[CFLAGS] { cc $CFLAGS -c program.c -o program ; }

When more flags are added after '-O2', Stu does not recompile
'program'.

Explanation:  Stu only looks at timestamps of files, and does not notice
when 'main.stu' is changed.  This is on purpose, as we expect Stu script
to be edited frequently, and we don't want to rebuilt all files with
hardcoded content on each pass.

Solutions:

(1) Remove the file 'CFLAGS' and re-run Stu.

(2) Write the content of the file 'CFLAGS' by hand, add the file
'CFLAGS' to version control, and declare the following in Stu:

    CFLAGS;

When the flags need to change, just edit 'CFLAGS' and Stu will do the
right thing.
