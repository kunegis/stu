Flags are an element syntax in Stu script that look like options in the shell.
They apply to individual dependencies. They can be thought as applying to each
edge in the dependency graph.

-o   Optional dependency
-p   Persistent dependency
-t   Transient dependency

The flags -o and -p are mutually exclusive.
