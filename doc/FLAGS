Flags are an element of syntax in Stu script that look like options in the
shell.  They apply to individual dependencies. They can be thought as applying
to each edge in the dependency graph.

-o   Optional dependency
-p   Persistent dependency
-t   Trivial dependency

(The flags -o and -p are mutually exclusive.)

Dynamic dependency flags:
-0   \0 separated
-n   \n separated
-C   Use Stu syntax (default)

Possible future flags:
-L   Follow symlinks
-d   Change directory
-a   Additional dependencies
-s   Secondary
-c   Command
-i   Interactive (following commands needs to be executed in the foreground)
<...and others...>
