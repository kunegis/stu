Flags in Stu apply to individual dependencies, and have a syntax
reminiscent of shell options.  More precisely, they can be thought as
applying to each edge in the dependency graph.

== List of flags ==

-o 	Optional dependency
-p	Persistent dependency
-t	Transient dependency

The flags -o and -p are mutually exclusive.
