Migrating from Make to Stu
==========================

A common pattern is to have a Makefile, and converting it to a Stu
script.  Here are some things to keep in mind for migrating from Make to
Stu. 

* Instead of Make variables, use files or transient targets 

Instead of 

   DATASETS = aaa bbb ccc

use
 
   DATASETS = { aaa bbb ccc }

and then just access the file 'DATASETS'. 

Instead of

FILES = aaa.h bbb.h ccc.h

Use 

@files:  aaa.h bbb.h ccc.h;

* Phony targets are called transient targets, and they have their own
  namespace, using the '@' prefix. 

* Use the options -o, -t and -p judiciously

* Never generate Stu source code automatically.
* Never call Stu recursively
* Use the -E option to get explanations for error messages.  You can set
  STU_OPTIONS in the environment to '-E' to set this persistently.
