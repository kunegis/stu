Stu in Use
==========

Here are links to large projects using Stu.  They are all by the authors
of Stu.


KONECT Analysis
---------------

These are extensive data mining operations being performed on a very
large collection of network datasets, as part of the KONECT project.
This is probably the largest Stu script in usage by the authors.

KONECT Extraction
-----------------

These are individual Stu scripts for generating the different network
datasets in the KONECT projects.  Most Stu scripts are short and handle
various oddities of the datasets.  Each subdirectory of extr/ has its
own Stu script ('main.stu'), but not that some directories still use a
Makefile, or no build automation at all.

Handbook of Network Analysis
----------------------------

This is the handbook of the KONECT project, and essentially a large and
complex Latex document compiled to PDF using Stu.  Stu handles
everything from assembling the plots from the KONECT project, to
generating the tarball that is regularly uploaded to arXiv.

KONECT World Wide Web Site
--------------------------

The World Wide Web site of the KONECT project (http://KONECT.cc/) is
generated automatically using Stu.  This project uses many very small
files -- a good test for Stu, and in particular for the parallel mode of
Stu.
