This file lists option letters used and proposed by Stu, and gives a
comparison to those prescribed by POSIX for Make, and those used in
other implementations of Make.

Legend
======

S   Implemented in Stu and considered stable with respect to version
    numbers:  The behavior will not be changed within the same major
    version number of Stu
s   Implemented in Stu and considered unstable:  May be subject to
    change at any time
M   Specified by POSIX Make
G   Implemented in GNU Make
F   Implemented in FreeBSD Make
.   Could be implemented in Stu
-   Not applicable to Stu
x   Incompatible
