Stu does not fit any existing software category neatly.  As such, it is
often compared with very diverse systems. 

== List of Tools == 

The following list gives competing system and explains how the differ
from Stu.  The main information that should be answered for each system: 
  - Does it allow parametrized rules?  (Including multiple parameters)
  - Does it allow dynamic dependencies?
  - Does it allow concatenation-like features?  (e.g., injecting all
    values from a list)
  - Does it have builtin rules?
  - Can it be used as a general-purpose build automation system?  (Not
    only for compiling)
  - Can it call any programs, or is it specific to rules in a certain
    programming language?

This list is currently a work in progress; items are added
sporadically.  The list is far from being complete. 

The list should be converted to a table with feature comparisons. 
________________________________________________________________________

Make and its many implementations and extensions 
  - Standardized
  - Has single unnamed parameter with %
  - No dynamic dependencies, but dialects allow certain tricks to
    emulate it, e.g. using 'include' with GNU Make and others

mk
  - The Make replacement of Plan 9
  - Similar to Make in general
  - No builtin rules.  Instead, allows to include files that define
    rules. 
  - Has parametrized rules with single parameter called '%' like
    Make (called metarules). 

Cook 
  - Has numbered parameters %1 %2 %2 ...
  - Sort-of has dynamic dependencies using:   NAME [cat NAME]  (The
    semantics are different because a change in NAME only does not lead
    to a re-build in Stu, as it should logically, but does in Cook.)
  - Like Stu, it uses the obvious syntax of enclosing commands in
    braces.  Unlike Stu, it uses a C-like syntax (rather than a
    shell-like syntax like Stu).

Ant
  - Java-specific 
  - No dynamic dependencies; Java plugins can be written instead 

Maven 
  - Java-compilation-specific

Jenkins
  - For software building/deploying/etc.

Other tools that may be perceived to be similar to Stu:

* Countless build tools for specific languages.  Almost all modern
  programming languages come with specific build systems (some are
  listed above).
