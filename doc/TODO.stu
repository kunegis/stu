-p data: { mkdir data ; }

# Alternatively, we may introduce the rule that for directories, the
# modification date is not used.  (Not a good idea because the date may
# be useful for directories in some cases.)  (Would also not be
# backward-compatible.)

# This can also work with other flags.

#
# Allow to handle symlinks as files in themselves, i.e., check for their
# own existence and their own timestamp.  This should not be the default
# as the current behaviour is more often useful, but should be available
# as a possibility, probably using a new flag (-L).
#

# What happens if the same target is used with and without "-L"?
A: B C {...}
B { ln -s ... B ; }
C:  -L { ln -s ... B ; }
# (this examples is incorrect)

#
# Make '~' work as the home directory.  Also for ~user/.  '~' is already
# forbidden as the first character in unquoted names.  Needs a new type for
# unparsed targets.  This is very similar to supporting environment variables.
#

#
# Allow access to environment variables via e.g. $(HOME).  Using this is
# likely to be an antipattern -- the idiomatic thing to do is set a
# symlink to the directory in question.  Other cases are even worse,
# e.g., having environment variables with lists of things in them.
#
# On the other hand, this will be useful after extended inclusion is
# implemented, to pass paths to Stu libraries.
#

#
# File import
#

# Import all rules from subdirectory; will prepend the directory name to
# all targets.  Rules from there will be executed from within the
# directory as current directory.  If using 'import', the meaning of
# all these are equivalent:
% import src/main.stu
% import src/
% import src
% include -d src/main.stu
% include -d src/
% include -d src
# The flag -d can be something else.

# - What about transient targets imported in that way.  Do we
#   prepend a directory to them?
%import dir   # contains:   @all:  ...;
# gets converted to:       @dir/all:  ...;
# or to:                   dir/@all:  ...;  # ???

#
# When doing %include or %import, allow to pass environment variables.
#

#
# Does it make sense to have a way to set environment variables for all
# commands?  It would open us up to many additional questions, and
# potentially some Make-like anti-patterns.  In general, Stu directives
# are prone to implement anti-patterns, as what they do is global.

# Line number and file syntax:  A preprocessor-like construct that gives a new

#
# A flag with the meaning "never rebuild that dependency", but only use
# it to determine whether we need to rebuilt the target.  It would mean
# that we can prune dependencies with that flag as soon as we know that
# the target must be built anyway.
#

# In this example, when 'program' does not exist, Stu will *not* build
# 'dep.sources', because the -s flag is used and Stu knows that
# 'program' has to be rebuilt anyway.  '-s' could stand for
# "secondary", and mean "we don't want this to be built, we only need it
# to determine whether we have to be rebuilt."

program:  -s [dep.sources] {
	cc ... -o program
}
dep.sources {
	# Some complex mechanism for determining the source code files
	# of the program
}

# This may be identical to
program:  [-o -p dep.sources] { ... }
# and "dep.sources" may even be a side effect of "program".

# This could be the first case where "-p -o" makes sense.  We want to allow "-po" for
# this.

#
# Have an option for: For hardcoded rules, compare the content of the file with
# the wanted content and don't update the file if identical.  Very useful when someone
# changes the content in the stu file, and then re-builds.  At the moment, it is a common
# complaint that Stu does _not_ re-build in that case.
