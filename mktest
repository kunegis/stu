# Perform all unit tests.  Each unit test is in one subdirectory of the
# directory test/.  By default, each test directory contains a file
# "main.stu" that performs one unit test.  Additional files may be
# present to configure how the test is performed.  
# 
# INVOCATION
#
#	$0 [TEST...] 
#
# Without any arguments, perform all tests.  With one or more arguments,
# perform the given tests.  The name of the tests are the names of the
# subdirectories of test/. 
#
# PARAMETERS
#
#     $emptyok	Set to non-empty to *not* output an error for empty test
#				directories; useful after doing "svn rm" on one, since
#				that leaves a directory containing only ".svn".  Ignores
#				dotfiles. 
#	  $NDEBUG	Set to nonempty to test the nondebug version; by default
#				the debug version is tested 
#
# OUTPUT
# 
#	error.log	List of tests that failed
#
# TEST SPECIFICATION 
#
# Each subdirectory of test/ contains one unit test, which follows the
# following rules: 
#
# * Each test contains a file 'main.stu' that is to be tested
# * It must build the file 'A' by default (i.e., that should be the
#   first target)
# * All built files must have names that correspond to the pattern given
#   below in delete_tmps(), such that they are removed automatically
#   after the test.  Most generated files' names just consist of a
#   single uppercase letter (but they don't have to).
# * There may be other files present used by the test; these are part of
#   the Stu release, i.e., they are in SVN. 
#
# SPECIFICATION FILES
#
# Each of these files can be placed in the individual test directory to
# enable additional checks.  All of these files are optional. 
#
# TARGET       The name of the target that is built in the test, instead
#              of the default 'A'.  This does not change the invocation:
#              Stu is invoked without arguments by default.  It only
#              changes the check that the file was built, and its
#              content.   
# CMD          Additional command arguments passed to Stu 
# PARALLEL     Give the arguments of the -j option for which the test is
#              to be executed 
# EXITCODE     The prescribed exit code 
# NOSECOND     If file is present, do not check that second invocation
#              results in "Nothing to be done"  
# CONTENT      Specifies text that must be present in the built file 
# STDOUT       The exact output of the command
# STDERR       The exact content of the error output
# INSTDOUT     Prescribe a string that must appear on stdout 
# INSTDERR     Prescribe strings that must appear in the error message.
#              Each line of INSTDERR contains a line that must be in the
#              error output (in any order).  
# NOTINSTDERR  A text that must not be present in the error output
# EXEC         Can be an alternative test script; it can do anything and
#              should return a sensible exit code (i.e., 0 on success,
#              nonzero otherwise)  
#
# NOTES
#
# * Some tests that use EXEC need to sleep, in order to make sure that
#   timestamps e.g. of a created file is older than Stu invocation.
#   Usually, these scripts use "sleep 2", i.e., sleep for two seconds to
#   make sure that there is a difference in timestamps of at least one
#   second on systems where file modification times have a precision of
#   only one second. 
#

# Note:  we can't use "set -e" here (which is a good general practice in
# shell scripts), because otherwise we can't use $? to check the exit
# code of Stu.  

# Set to "1" on error
