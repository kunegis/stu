# Perform unit tests.  Each unit test is in one subdirectory of the directory
# tests/.  By default, each test directory contains a file 'main.stu' that
# performs one unit test.  Additional files may be present to configure how the
# test is performed; see below. 
# 
# INVOCATION
#
#	$0 [TEST]...
#
# Without any arguments, perform all tests.  With one or more arguments,
# perform the given tests.  The given test names are the names of the
# subdirectories of tests/, and may or may not include the 'tests/'
# prefix.  The arguments may contain glob patterns.  (No test names
# contain the glob characters *, ?, etc.) 
#
# OUTPUT FILES
#     log/error.log		List of tests that failed, one name per line
#
# PARAMETERS
#     $NDEBUG	Set to non-empty to test the nondebug version; by default
#		the debug version is tested 
#     $VARIANT  Other variant of the compiled file; the default is to
#		take the file that matches the value of $NDEBUG
#     $verbose  Set to {0,1,2} for verbose levels; default is 0
#     $notall	If non-empty, exit on the first error, instead of
#		running everything  
#     $emptyok	Set to non-empty to *not* output an error for empty test
#               directories; useful after doing "rm" in a version
#		control system on one, since that leaves a directory
#		containing only (e.g.) ".svn".  Ignores dotfiles. 
#
# EXIT STATUS 
#     0		All tests succeeded
#     1		At least one test failed
#     2		Internal error 
#
# TEST SPECIFICATION 
#
# Each subdirectory of tests/ contains one unit test, which follows the
# following rules: 
#
# * Each test contains a Stu file 'main.stu' that is to be tested
# * It must build the file 'A' by default (i.e., that should be the
#   first target)
# * All built files must have names that correspond to the pattern given
#   in sh/rm_tmps, such that they are removed automatically
#   after the test.  Most generated files' names just consist of a
#   single uppercase letter (but they don't have to).
# * There may be other files present used by the test; these are part of
#   the Stu release, i.e., they are under version control. 
#
# SPECIFICATION FILES
#
# Each of these files can be placed in the individual test directory to
# enable additional checks or behaviors.  All of these files are optional. 
#
# TARGET       The name of the target that is built in the test, instead
#              of the default 'A'.  This does not change the invocation:
#              Stu is invoked without arguments by default.  It only
#              changes the check that the file was built, and its
#              content.   May be an empty file to omit testing for an
#	       existing target.  
# CMD          Additional command arguments passed to Stu.  Content may
#  	       use shell quoting and escaping.  For instance, the file
#	       may contain -C ' A ' to pass an argument beginning and ending
#              in space to Stu. 
# CMDPREFIX    Prefix before command.  Used to set environment variables. 
# PARALLEL     Give the arguments of the -j option for which the test is
#              to be executed 
# EXITSTATUS   The prescribed exit status; default is zero
# NOSECOND     If file is present, do not check that second invocation
#              results in "Targets are up to date" (A second run is only
#	       made if the prescribed exit status is not zero.)
# NOTTY	       Don't do the extra TTY test (e.g., when the -q option is
#	       used and the exit status is expected to be one)
# NOCOLOR      Don't test for color in stderr (e.g., with the -y option)
# CONTENT      Prescribe the exact content of the built file
# INCONTENT    Prescribe strings that must appear in the built file 
# STDOUT       The exact output of Stu
# STDERR       The exact error output of Stu
# INSTDOUT     Prescribe strings that must appear in Stu's output
# INSTDERR     Prescribe strings that must appear in Stu's error output
# NOTINSTDERR  A text that must not be present in Stu's error output
# TTYSTDOUTERR The output and error output (interleaved) when in TTY mode
# EXEC         Can be an alternative test script; it can do anything and
#              should return a sensible exit status (i.e., 0 on success,
#              1 on test failed, 2 on internal error).  It also otherwise
#	       behaves like sh/test, e.g., output '***' only on error.
#
# For the files beginning with 'IN', each line contains a string that
# must be present, in any order. 
#
# NAMES OF TESTS
#
# The names of unit tests, i.e., the name of the directories under tests/
# follow a pattern:
#
# * tests/VERSION-ID
#	These are tests for features introduced in Stu version VERSION.
#	This was introduced in Stu 2.5, and therefore the assignment of
#	VERSION numbers for older versions is approximate.  The goal is
#	to be able to run all tests in asciibetical order so as to test
#	older features first.  Presumably, these are the features that
#	should be fixed first when working on Stu.
# * tests/NAME-ID (deprecated)
#	These are tests for the feature named NAME, with ID being an
#	integer.  These are being migrated to the VERSION-ID scheme.
# * tests/long-NAME
#	These are tests that take a long time to run.  I.e., at least
#       one second, due to sleep being used.  We try to avoid this as
#  	much as possible, but sometimes sleeping is the only way to test
# 	something. 
#
# NOTES
#
# * Some tests that use EXEC need to sleep, in order to make sure that
#   timestamps e.g. of a created file is older than Stu invocation.
#   Usually, these scripts use "sleep 2", i.e., sleep for two seconds to
#   make sure that there is a difference in timestamps of at least one
#   second on systems where file modification times have a precision of
#   only one second.  An alternative is to use sh/touch_old. 
# * Tests output '***' only in case of error.  This is convenient for
#   grepping while the tests are running.
# * Tests use 'diff' to compare files, not 'cmp'. 
#
# TODO
#
# * For each test, interrupt the test after a specified timeout, to
#   avoid that the whole testing procedure hangs when a single test
#   hangs. 
#

# Note:  we can't use "set -e" here (which is a good general practice in
# shell scripts), because otherwise we can't use $? to check the exit
# code of Stu.
