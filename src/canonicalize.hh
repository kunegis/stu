/*
 * Canonicalization is the mapping of filenames and transient names to
 * unique names in their simplest form with respect to the filename
 * components '/' and '.'.
 *
 * This function canonicalizes a string, and is used by higher-level
 * code to canonicalize actual names.  The function is called both on
 * entire names (when they are non-parametrized), as well as on parts of
 * names (when they are parametrized).
 *
 * METHOD
 *
 *  - Fold /
 *      - Multiple / -> single /
 *          - except for double slash at the start not followed by /
 *            (This is because POSIX mandates that a name starting with
 *            exactly two slashes is special.)
 *      - Remove ending /
 *          - except when the name contains only '/' characters, i.e.,
 *            when the name is '/' or double slash.
 *  - Fold .
 *      - ^/.$ -> /
 *      - ^./$ -> .
 *      - ^./ -> ''  [multiple times] [not when followed by parameter]
 *      - /./ -> /   [multiple times]
 *      - /.$ -> ''  [multiple times]
 *
 * Symlinks and '..' are not canonicalized by Stu.  As a general rule,
 * no stat(2) is performed to check whether name components exist.
 *
 * For further rules about canonicalization (which are outside the scope of this
 * function), see the manpage.  Some of the special rules are handled in this
 * file.
