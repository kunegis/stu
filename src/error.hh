/*
 * Errors codes in Stu are represented by integers between 0 and 4, as defined
 * in the ERROR_* constants below.  Zero represents no error.  These codes are
 * used for both Stu's exit status and as values that are stored in ints, as
 * well as thrown and caught.  Variables containing error codes are ints and are
 * named "error".
 */

/*
 * Format of error output:  There are two types of error output lines:
 * error messages and backtraces.  Error messages are of the form
 *
 *         $0: $MESSAGE
 *
 * and backtraces are of the form
 *
 *         $FILENAME:$LINE:$COLUMN: $MESSAGE
 *
 * Backtraces are used when it is possible to refer to a specific location
 * in the input files (or command line, etc.).  Error messages are
 * avoided:  all errors should be traced back to a place in the source if
 * possible.  But sometimes they must be used.
 */

/*
 * Wording of messages:  Both error messages and backtraces begin with lowercase
 * letters. Filenames are quotes with double quotes.  Operators and flags are
 * not quoted.  Messages for neither type of error output lines are terminated
 * by periods.
 *
 * Typical forms of error messages are:
 *
 *    Location 2: expected an AAA, not BBB
 *    Location 1: in CCC
 *
 *    Location 2: AAA must not be used
 *    Location 1: in BBB
 *
 *    Location 2: AAA must not be used
 *    Location 1: in FEATURE using OPERATOR
 *
 * Use "expected TOKEN" instead of "missing TOKEN".  That's because
 * some tokens in the given list may be optional, making the "missing"
 * phrasing confusing, as it would imply that the token is mandatory.
 * Include a definite or indefinite article after "expected" to avoid
 * interpreting "expected" as an adjective.
 *
 * "not BBB" mentions the invalid token.  If end-of-file is encountered,
 * the "not BBB" part is omitted.
 *
 * Use "must not" rather than "cannot" or "shall" in error messages when
 * something must be present, but is erroneous, e.g., "filename must not
 * be empty".  On the other hand, use "cannot" when something completely
 * unexpected was encountered, e.g., "transient targets cannot be used
 * with copy rule".
 *
 * Operators and other syntax elements are often introduced by the word
 * "using" rather than "with", etc., e.g., "expected a filename after
 * input redirection using "<"".  We always mention both the operator as
 * well as its function.
 *
 * When referring to dependencies and targets, we don't use the words
 * "dependency" or "target".  For instance, just write ""X" is needed by
 * "A"" instead of "dependency "X" is needed by "A"".  The exception is
 * when the word "dependency" is qualified, e.g. "dynamic dependency [X]
 * must not have input redirection using "<"", or when referring
 * specifically to a dependency with respect to a target.
 *
 * But remember that in general it is better to state what what expected
 * in the syntax than to say that what was encountered cannot be used.
 * For instance, say "expected a filename" instead of "filename must not
 * be empty".  This cannot always be done, so "must not" is sometimes
 * used.
 *
 * Even though error messages should contain all the information
 * mentioned above, they should still be terse.  More information is
 * included in the explanations using the -E options, output by the
 * explain_*() functions.

/*
 * Build errors (code 1) are errors encountered during the normal
 * operation of Stu.  They indicate failures of the executed commands or
 * errors with files.  Exit status 1 is also used for the -q option
 * (question mode), when the targets are not up to date.
 *
 * Logical errors (code 2) are errors with the usage of Stu.  These are
 * for instance syntax errors in Stu scripts, cycles in the dependency
 * graph, or multiple matching rules.
 *
 * Fatal errors (code 4) are errors that lead Stu to abort immediately,
 * even when the -k option is used.  They are avoided as much as
 * possible.
 *
 * The value 127 is only used from a child process between fork() and exec(), as
 * done e.g. by system(), posix_spawn(), and the shell.
 *
 * Errors 1 and 2 are recoverable.  If the -k option ("keep going") is
 * given, Stu notes these errors and continues.  If the -k option is not
 * given, they cause Stu to abort.  When the -k option is used, the
 * final exit status may combine errors 1 and 2, giving exit status 3.
 * Error 4 is unrecoverable, and leads to Stu aborting immediately.
 * Error 4 is never combined with other errors.
 *
 * Fatal errors are rare and are only used in cases where it is OK to
 * abort the whole Stu process:
 *    - When there are errors in the usage of Stu on the command line,
 *      e.g. non-existing options.  In these cases, we don't lose
 *      anything because nothing was yet started.
 *    - Errors that happen just before Stu exits anyway.
 *    - Errors that should not happen, such as failure to set up a
 *      signal handler.
 *
 * We have to be careful with calling exit(ERROR_FATAL):  We cannot do
 * it when child processes could still be running.  For errors that
 * happen in the middle of a Stu run, it makes more sense to generate a
 * build error.  In the very few cases that absolutely need to be fatal
 * (such as malloc() returning null), we call abort() instead, since
 * that will take care of terminating the child processes.
