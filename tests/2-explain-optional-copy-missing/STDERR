main.stu:1:8: source file 'B' in optional copy rule must exist
main.stu:1:1: when target file 'A' does not exist
Explanation: In copy rules whose source file is declared as optional
using the -o option, the source file may be missing only if the target file
is present.  It is an error if both the source and the target files
are missing.
