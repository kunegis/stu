main.stu:2:2: flag -o cannot be used
main.stu:2:4: before phony target @all
Explanation: Only the flags -p and -o can be used before targets of a
rule.  In that case, the flags will always apply to that target.  Flags
cannot be used before phony targets.  If a rule has multiple targets,
each flag only applies to the target immediately following it.
