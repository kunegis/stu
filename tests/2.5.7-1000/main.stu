# Tested in non-interactive mode, i.e., without the -i option. 
# This works, as the command has /dev/null as its standard input, and
# therefore 'cat' returns immediately.  If stdin of the child process is
# not set, the child process would either be stopped (when it is in the
# background), or wait indefinitely (when it is in the foreground).
# Thus, this test will hang, if the standard input of commands in
# non-interactive mode is not redirected from /dev/null.
