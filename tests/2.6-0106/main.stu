# Does $X/bbb/$Y match bbb/bbb/bbb as
# 	 *   (1) $X = . and $Y = bbb/bbb , or
#	 *   (2) $X = bbb and $Y = bbb ?
#	 * Answer:  It's (2), because that's not special rule (c).

A:  list.bbb/list.bbb/list.bbb {
	cp list.bbb/list.bbb/list.bbb A
}

$X/list.bbb/$Y {
	[ "x$X" = xlist.bbb ] || exit 1
	[ "x$Y" = xlist.bbb ] || exit 1
	mkdir -p "$X"/list.bbb
	echo CORRECT >"$X"/list.bbb/"$Y"
}
