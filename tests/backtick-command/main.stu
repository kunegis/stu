# Backtikcs work like quotes -- they are finished by a backtick,
# regardless of whether their content is a proper shell expression.  In
# this example, the backticks contain an unifinished expression, and
# thus the target will fail, making Stu exit with exit code 1.  If Stu
# wrongly parsed the backticks (as allowing further nesting), then it
# would fail with exit code 2 because the command would not be
# finished.

    # if Stu parsed the open-paren, then it would fail with the message
    # 'unfinished command'.
    echo `echo (`

    # Note:  the syntax error in the backtick expansion need not result
    # in an error, therefore fail explicitly using exit. 
    exit 1
