# A dependency is both a dynamic dependency and a
# dynamic variable dependency. 
#
# This is the pattern used when building a tarball. 
#

# The "tarball" (in this test, only a concatenation of the files)  
A:  [B] $[B]
{
	# We use cat as a poor man's tar, for testing purposes 
    cat $B >A
}

# The list of files to out into the tarball
B: {
    echo X Y Z >B
}

# The individual files to put into the tarball 
X: { echo xxx >X }
Y: { echo yyy >Y }
Z: { echo zzz >Z }
