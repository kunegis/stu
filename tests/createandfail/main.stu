#
# When a command fails, the target file is removed if it was created.
# This is the same behavior as Make. 
#
# In the following example, the command always creates the file "A" and
# then fails, and Stu should thus remove the file "A". 
#


A: {
   # Always create "A"
   echo aslhajksdh >A
   
   # Then fail
