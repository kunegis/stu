# This tests high-order nesting of dynamic targets.  Precisely, [A] will
# resolve to the dependency

# [[[....[[[A]]]...]]]

# where the number of bracket pairs equals the number stored in the file
# 'N'.  We chose a value larger than 64 to catch implementations that
# may use bitfields to store information about dependencies.  And also
# just to be testing a very high nesting, which may leading to slow
# executions with bad algorithms. 
# 
# This particular test will create a missing dependency in all that to
# test the trace printing functions.
