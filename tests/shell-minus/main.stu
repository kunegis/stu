# Is '-x' correctly passed as a command, or will '-x' be interpreted as
# an option by the shell? 

# Solution:  include '--' after '-c'.  Is that POSIX-compliant?  Do it
# only when the command starts with '-' or '+'. 

# '-x' must be interpreted by the shell as a command which is not in the
# path, which will make the shell exit with code 127.  If the '-x' is
# interpreted as another option, the shell will fail due to a missing
# argument to '-c', giving another exit code that 127. 
A {-x}
